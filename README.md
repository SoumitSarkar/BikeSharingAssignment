# Project Name: Bike Sharing Assignment
> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.

## General Information

### Business Goal
> The goal of the company is:
    - To determine factors **weathersit**, **season**, **yr** etc. that may influence the demand for these shared bikes in the US market.
    - To develop a model based on those factors, that would explain the variations in the demand for these shared bikes
    - To know the R-squared of the model, i.e. how well those factors capture consumer demand for bikes. 

## About Dataset
Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.


## Conclusions
1) **Top influencers** listed sequentially based on their potential to predict shared bike demand:
  - ***yr*** (the topmost influencer)
  - ***season_spring*** (the second-most top influencer)
  - ***weathersit_precipitation*** (the third-most top influencer)
